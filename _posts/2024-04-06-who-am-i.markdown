💭 i don't know who i am, so i figured i could share that with the internet because why not? 
i spent my entire childhood being who i thought i should be in order to survive. 
i didn't study what i wanted to study. i have no idea who or what i want to be, and frankly i have no idea how to find it out either.  
🎥 this week i've seen [**the book of clarence**](https://letterboxd.com/vinjii/film/the-book-of-clarence-2023/) and [**monkey man**](https://letterboxd.com/vinjii/film/monkey-man/)    
📺 i fell into an abyss called **criminal minds,** and i'm on s3. spencer reid is a new favourite character.  
🎮 playing **baldur's gate 3** with my dear friend gembla  
💜 i'm thankful for our weekly dnd sessions (playing as a chaotic thief corvid who likes shiny things) and my friends  
🍴 made a sausage bake with balsamic vinegar and herbs but other than that i lived off mcdonald's wraps.  
✒️ procrastinated like a queen who suffers from impostor syndrome and perfectionism, but finally set up my website.
