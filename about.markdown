# About Page

Swiss lesbian 🌈 somewhere in the UK. Made of 📚 📺 and 🎮 She/Her 💜 Chaotic, genre-confused author, and excellent editor. She's currently trying to figure out her life, a thing she thinks she should have done a long time ago. In the meantime, she writes mostly science fiction and fantasy while traveling in order to pet as many dogs as possible.
