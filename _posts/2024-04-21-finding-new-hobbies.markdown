💭 I was discussing hobbies with my dad (do I want to learn Japanese, Korean, Mandarin or start making soap?) and he suggested a photography course. Not a bad shout, dad. Not a bad shout.  
Drawing? I loved drawing as a teen, but my mother once told me that I have no talent. And I lost all interest in it, but as I've realised lately, a lot of my life decisions (degree, job, etc.) and hobbies are in response to what I thought was expected of me.  
How do I figure out what I want to do? How do I explore creativity when I've willingly stuffed myself into a box all of my life?

🎥 I discussed going to the movies with my dad, so let's see if he's actually going to come with me.

📺 **Criminal Minds**, Season Four. 

🎮 I bought [Planescape: Torment](https://store.steampowered.com/app/466300/Planescape_Torment_Enhanced_Edition/) on sale and started it on my Steam Deck. It obviously is made for keyboard and mouse, but it works for now. I also started a new [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/) colony.

📚 [Foreigner by C.J. Cherryh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57043.Foreigner) - a buddy read over on the [Fantasy Buddy Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/192999) group on Goodreads. I'm still struggling with reading, but I desperately miss it. I made a list of books to read with C. Looking at mostly award winning SFF.  

🎵 Taylor Swift's [The Tortured Poets Department](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/taylor-swift-the-tortured-poets-department-review-1235006977/) - Dear Taylor, thank you for writing songs specifically about my life. I appreciate the effort. I cried. That album is like therapy, and I'm not even a Swiftie. *[And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free.](https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-so-long-london-lyrics)*

💜 Call with L. Dungeons & Dragons with friends. [Garage Fiction](https://garagefiction.com/) call.

🍴 I made a lovely spiced minced meat & tomato sauce to eat with pasta, and chicken with a curry sauce over rice.

🏃 Wed: 3.5K run; Sun: 4K run

✒️ Procrastination wins. Where is C, and his accountability?
