💭 I've met an author once who makes a living writing Jane Austen fanfiction, and it blew my mind.

🎥 [Ordinary Angels](https://letterboxd.com/vinjii/film/ordinary-angels/) 4/5, [Civil War](https://letterboxd.com/vinjii/film/civil-war-2024/) 3.5/5

📺 **Criminal Minds,** just finished S3 and started S4. Put **Fallout** (Amazon Prime) on my to watch list.

🎮 Installed the [Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/) demo on my Steam Deck. Added a few visual novels to my Steam [wish list](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/vinjii).

📚 Bought RJ Barker's [Gods of the Wyrdwood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62874007-gods-of-the-wyrdwood). Updated my Amazon wish list.

💜 Long phone calls with several friends. Really thankful for L and her daughter. Long live Gemini. J drove for hours to get Blue.
