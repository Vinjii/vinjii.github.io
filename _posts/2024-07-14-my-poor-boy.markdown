💭 Blue's dead. He tested my non-faith on his way out. As most of my friends know, I don't believe in the universe, gods, karma, only in chance and coincidence. It was a peaceful moment, we were able to let him go outside in the sun with a lovely view over Switzerland. About 90 minutes later, on this warm and sunny day, a cloud passed and unleashed a five minute downpour while the sun was still shining. The most beautiful complete rainbow appeared right in front of our balcony. It's an understatement to say that I sobbed...  

🎥 I went to see **Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle** with R.  

📺 **The Great** ended well, but those last few episodes had a shift in tone, which I found slightly depressing. Started **Not Dead Yet**, and so far I find it fairly amusing. **Evil** is an incredibly engrossing supernatural and psychological drama by the creators of **The Good Wife & The Good Fight**.  

🎮 I started playing a new auto-chess game on iOS: **Team Fight Tactics**.  

🎵 Who would have thought that Blondie would one day get me through the worst months in my life? Is it healthy to listen to one person without any breaks? Last week was **1989** and now this week it's **Fearless**.  
I saw her again in Zurich (N1) and the crowd was amazing. I could actually hear her. And singing some of these songs with her is genuinely better than therapy (I'm kidding). I want to see her again.  

💜 I've never met a more supportive bunch than my friends, but my secret guilty pleasure these last few days has been fanfiction.  

🍴 Raclette on a balcony in summer? Hello Switzerland.  

✒️ I'm working. Slowly. But I am.
