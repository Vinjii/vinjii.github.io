💭 I'm free (of responsibilities.)  

🎥 **A Quiet Place II** 3.5/5  

📚 Fanfiction until 2AM all the way.  

🎵 I'm in a bit of a manic Taylor Swift phase, only interrupted by Billie Eilish's new album. Yes, still. **1989** and **TTPD** mostly. *Laughing with my feet in your lap, like you were my closest friend.* (Yes, that's a different album.)  

💜 The fact *everyone* showed up for me. I've chosen one thing well in my life, and that's my friends.  

🍴 Went for a [lovely dinner](https://www.seeblickburgaeschi.ch/) at a nearby lake and ate a delicious plate with roast beef, tartare sauce, and chips.  

🏃 I'm walking through the beautiful Swiss scenery, and it makes me so happy.  

✒️ I'm writing. It's all nonsense, but I'm writing.
