💭 i don't know who i am, so i figured i could share that with the internet because why not?  
🎥 this week i've seen [**the book of clarence**](https://letterboxd.com/vinjii/film/the-book-of-clarence-2023/) and **monkey man**  
📺 i fell into an abyss called **criminal minds** and i'm on s3  
🎮 playing **baldur's gate 3** with gembla  
💜 dnd (playing as a chaotic thief corvid who likes shiny things) and my friends  
🍴 made a sausage bake with balsamic vinegar and herbs  
✒️ procrastinated like a queen who suffers from impostor syndrome and perfectionism
