💭 I don't know who I am, so I figured I could share that and other thoughts with the Internet because, well, why not? 
I spent my entire childhood being who I thought I had to be in order to survive. 
I didn't study what I wanted to study (to be honest, I didn't know what I *wanted* to study). I have no idea who or what I want to be, and frankly I don't know how to find that out. Someone send help.  

🎥 This week, I've seen [**The Book of Clarence**](https://letterboxd.com/vinjii/film/the-book-of-clarence-2023/) 3/5, and [**Monkey Man**](https://letterboxd.com/vinjii/film/monkey-man/).    

📺 I seem to have fallen into an abyss called **Criminal Minds,** and I'm on season three. Spencer Reid is a new favourite character, and Penelope Garcia might be my new fictional wife.  

🎮 Still playing **Baldur's Gate 3** with my dear friend Gembla.  

📚 I haven't been reading. Whenever my mental health is in the gutter, books is the thing I struggle with the most, which is funny since as a child it was my main form of escapism.  

💜 I'm thankful for our weekly DnD sessions (playing as a chaotic thief corvid who likes shiny things), and my friends.  

🔗 One thing I want to start doing again is being mindful of what I consume on the Internet.

🍴 I made a sausage bake with balsamic vinegar and herbs, but other than that I lived off Mcdonald's wraps.  

✒️ I procrastinated like a queen who suffers from impostor syndrome and perfectionism, but finally set up [my website](https://livhofer.com).
