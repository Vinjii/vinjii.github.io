💭 I thrive on chaos, and as C. said perhaps I need more chaos, but this week I'm mostly just sad because I'd finally convinced myself that I wanted *her* and not chaos. Heh.
In general, this was a week filled with a lot more sadness than I would have liked. Then C. made me project manage my life with a Trello board. Where do I sue?

🎥 I'm trying to decide between a Curzon membership or Mubi. I enjoy the cinema, but from L's it's a lot more difficult to get there.

📺 Continued watching **Criminal Minds** with E. Watched an episode of **Buffy.** Low-key tempted to re-watch **Gossip Girl,** or perhaps finally watch **One Tree Hill.** I should finish **Desperate Housewives!** I asked Mastodon what kind of addictive shows they recommend, but I think I watched most of it.

📚 [C.L. Polk: Even Though I Knew The End](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59807975) - I loved this noir urban fantasy with angels and demons.

💜 Friday night consisted of a wonderful D&D session.

🍴 Made a cottage pie for my dad's sister and her husband, and my dad bought me a steak, and it's the biggest steak I've ever seen.
