💭 I thrive on chaos, and as C. said perhaps I need more chaos, but this week I'm mostly just sad because I'd finally convinced myself that I wanted *her* and not chaos. Heh.
In general, this was a week filled with a lot more sadness than I would have liked. Then C. made me project manage my life with a Trello board. Where do I sue?

🎥 I'm trying to decide between a Curzon membership or Mubi. I enjoy the cinema, but from L's it's a lot more difficult to get there.

📺 Continued watching **Criminal Minds** with E. Watched an episode of **Buffy.** Low-key tempted to re-watch **Gossip Girl,** or perhaps finally watch **One Tree Hill.** I should finish **Desperate Housewives!** I asked Mastodon what kind of addictive shows they recommend, but I think I watched most of it.

📚 [C.L. Polk: Even Though I Knew The End](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59807975) - I loved this noir urban fantasy with angels and demons. I started a re-read of [Sense and Sensibility](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/161/pg161-images.html) because C is reading it for the first time, and I've discovered that according to Austen, I'm probably riddle with arthritis, and near death. (Unfortunately, Austen was near death at my age. What an absolute loss.) And finally, I read Premee Mohamed's [And What Can We Offer You Tonight?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58130437-and-what-can-we-offer-you-tonight)

💜 Friday night consisted of a wonderful D&D session.

🍴 Made a cottage pie for my dad's sister and her husband, and my dad bought me a steak, and it's the biggest steak I've ever seen.
