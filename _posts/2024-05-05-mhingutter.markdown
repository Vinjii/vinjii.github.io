💭 Last year, I read two books about happiness in order to try to figure out how I could be happier for *her.* Hahaha.

🎥 J chose a film called [Spaceman](https://boxd.it/6oV72L), and well, Sandler attending therapy in space with a spider therapist was *something*.

📺 **Criminal Minds.** Why does Spencer Reid always suffer? I'm done with season 4.  

📚 Updated [The Story Graph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/vinjii) website. Unfortunately, I still prefer [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/vinjii). [The Loneliest Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6477093163) in the Universe by Lauren James, and [The Coworker](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6471052289) by Freida McFadden. 

🎵 *And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn.* - Taylor Swift  

💜 First GFP call with C. Moved Blue to E's.  

🍴 I made my first whole chicken in the air-fryer.  

🏃 Not enough. I need to run more. Or I'll suffer.  

✒️ Did some editing. Mostly failed.
